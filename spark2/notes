Intro :

Is there anyone who never heard of Apache Spark ?
Who among you used it even once and knows the concept of RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) ?

Spark 2 features :

TPC-DS queries
99 queries that any Big Data processing tool should be able to handle
 includes a very large percentage of the SQL 2003 standard
 => you can do about every operations you might want to perform on an SQL database



Dataset APIs :

All 3 are compatible and can be used one after the other on the same set of data

-

Analysis errors caught before distributed batch job starts

SparkSession :

Before : sqlContext/

    HiveContext : work with Hive and window functions

    Window functions allow users of Spark SQL to calculate results such as the rank of a given row or a moving average over a range of input rows.

    Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis

In spark 2 :

    Not all problems solved : you still need Hive dependencies to use features such as window functions
