What is Docker and why is it so popular : http://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/

What is docker ?
    Containers run apps natively on the host machineâ€™s kernel. They have better performance characteristics than virtual machines that only get virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. Containers can get native access, each one running in a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable.

Layers
    Each layer has a different size
    The total of those sizes is the size of the image

    A docker image is a tarball, more accurately a tarball of tarballs

Dockerfile
    Each instruction represent one layer

Data transfer & Security
    Reduce costs : ex between AWS region and your datacenter if containers in remote registry or the opposite

Cleanup

    You cannot change the size of a layer by adding more layers

Group commands :

    Less layers (LABEL, ENV etc) means less requests when uploading or downloading . More a matter of organisation and good practice than size saving.
